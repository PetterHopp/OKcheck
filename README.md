packages: `NVIconfig`, `NVIdb`, `NVIpjsr`, `NVIspatial`, `NVIpretty`,
`NVIbatch`, `OKplan`, `OKcheck`, `NVIcheckmate`, `NVIpackager`,
`NVIrpackages`. See [Contribute to
OKcheck](https://github.com/NorwegianVeterinaryInstitute/OKcheck/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for more information.

## Installation

`OKcheck` is available in package manager for workbench and at
[GitHub](https://github.com/NorwegianVeterinaryInstitute). If needed,
you can install the development version from the dev-branch at the
GitHub repo, see below.

#### Workbench

To install `OKcheck` on workbench, run the following code:

    install.packages("OKcheck")

If you need changes that only are available in the development version,
please make contact to the developers so that a new release can be
published on Workbench.

#### At personal computer

You may install the package with or without vignettes. Although it will
be easier to install without vignettes, it is recommended to install
with vignettes for all `NVIverse` packages except
`c("NVIrpackages", "NVIconfig")`.

To install `OKcheck` you will need:

-   R version &gt; 4.1.0
-   R package `remotes`
-   Rtools version 4.0, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 or 4.5 depending on R version

First install and attach the `remotes` package.

    install.packages("remotes")
    library(remotes)

To install (or update) `OKcheck` without vignettes, run the following
code:

    remotes::install_github("NorwegianVeterinaryInstitute/OKcheck",
        upgrade = FALSE,
        build = TRUE,
        build_vignettes = FALSE)

To install (or update) `OKcheck` with vignettes, you will need to first
install some additional R-packages needed to build the vignettes. Check
README below in the section [Vignettes](#vignettes) to see the vignettes
that are available. To install the package with the vignettes, first
install the packages: `knitr`, `rmarkdown`, `R.rsp`, and `NVIrpackages`
(from GitHub) if they are missing. If you don’t use R-studio, you will
also need to install Pandoc. Then run the following code:

    remotes::install_github("NorwegianVeterinaryInstitute/OKcheck",
        upgrade = FALSE,
        build = TRUE,
        build_vignettes = TRUE)

To install (or update) the development version (dev-branch) of `OKcheck`
(with vignettes), run the following code:

    remotes::install_github("NorwegianVeterinaryInstitute/OKcheck",
        ref = "dev",
        upgrade = FALSE,
        build = TRUE,
        build_vignettes = TRUE)
